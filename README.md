# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

This project is part of my internship task at **CodeAlpha**.  
It uses the classic **Iris dataset** to train a Decision Tree model that predicts the type of Iris flower based on measurements.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.12
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `Iris_Flower_Classification_AliAbbas.ipynb` â†’ Complete machine learning notebook

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Loads the Iris dataset using scikit-learn
- Trains a Decision Tree Classifier
- Achieves 100% accuracy on test data
- Predicts flower types based on input

## ðŸ§  Future Plan
A simple UI will be added in the next phase of this project using Tkinter or Streamlit.
